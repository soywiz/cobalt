# Cobalt

**Cobalt** is a *multiplatform* utilities library for Kotlin. It has *JVM* and *JS* targets
and contains modules for *data binding*, *logging*, *eventing* and *networking*. **Note that**
Cobalt is only intended to be used from **Kotlin** projects and it is not optimized for *JS* nor
*Java* projects.
